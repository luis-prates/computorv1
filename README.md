# 42 Computor v1
42_Computor v1 

## Summary
This project is the first in a series that aims to make you rekindle with maths. They will be quite useful - not to say essential - for numerous projects to come.

## Description
This project aims to get acquainted with handling elementary math tools that may be helpful for other 42 projects. You will not “do math for doing math”, but to develop a progressive and relaxed approach to projects where these tools are needed. You can choose the language of your choice for this subject.

## Mandatory part
Write a program that solves a polynomial second or lower-degree equation. You will have
to show at least:

• The equation in its reduced form.

• The degree of the equation.

• Its solution(s) and the polarity of the discriminant if it makes sense.

We will always expect the entry to have the right format, i.e. every term respects the form $a∗x^p$. Exponents are organized and present. Beware, it doesn’t mean the equation has a solution! If so, your program should detect it and specify it. You should also think of zero, negative, or non-whole coefficients...
There might be exceptions you will have to manage. In the equation $42∗X^0 = 42∗X^0$, for instance, each real number is a solution...
